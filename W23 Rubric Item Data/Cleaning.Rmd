# TODO Xinhui 




#Ideas on how to match them 

### Variables needed for each student 
 - # mistakes on each exam 
 - # mistakes on each question (ie H0 , H1, OPDEF, etc) on each exam
 - At each time point for each Prompt: # of Unique mistakes or past exams 
 - # Attempts 
 - # time point 
 - For each student for each prompt list of items given --- append after each exam new items given 



Brainstorming: 

On H0items 

FOR (each Student)
  FOR ( each H0item on EXAM1)
    On exam 2? 
      Yes + 1 =  repH0
      No + 1 = newH0

H0 = repH0/totalH0



On H1items 

FOR (each Student)
  FOR (each H0item on EXAM1)
    On exam 2? 
      Yes + 1 repH1 
      No + 1 = newH1

H1 = repH1/totalH1
