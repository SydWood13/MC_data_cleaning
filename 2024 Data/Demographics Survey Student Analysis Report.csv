Study:The effectiveness of teaching strategies in undergraduate courses
Victoria Cross, PhD. from the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Davis (UCD) is conducting a research study. We are interested in the effectiveness of strategies used to teach undergraduate psychology courses. You were selected as a participant in this study because you are currently enrolled in a Psychology class at UCD. Your participation in this study is voluntary, you may choose to withdraw your data from the study at any time by contacting the researchers listed below. Your decision to participate (or not to participate) will not affect your relationship with UCD, your grades or your class standing.

Why is this study being done?
Undergraduate instructors use a wide variety of strategies and techniques to optimize student’s learning. For example, many courses at UCD use in-class response systems like iClickers, and provide students with quizzes online or in class. In this study, we are interested in evaluating the effectiveness of some of these teaching techniques. We will examine whether the efficacy of certain strategies varies depending on student demographics and whether the way in which the instructor chooses to implement these techniques (e.g., the timing of quizzes and their content) influences learning.

What will happen if I take part in this research study?
As a research participant you are being asked to fill out a brief pre-course, mid-quarter and / or end of quarter survey. Surveys will be completed online and take about 5-10 minutes to complete. You may be asked about your study strategies and habits, your knowledge of psychology concepts, and/or your opinions about the course. Completing these surveys is optional, and will not affect your grade in this course in any way. Your course work (e.g., clicker questions, quizzes, tests,Mini Personality Inventory and other extra credit assignments) will also be collected for research purposes upon completion of the course. This will all be merged with demographic data from your survey responses, such as your gender, ethnicity, and grades, using your student identification number. Finally, we are asking for permission to follow-up with you about participating in future studies related to your experience in this course.

Are there any potential risks or discomforts associated with this study?
There are no anticipated risks or discomforts associated with participating in this study. Data will be collected as part of your regular classroom activities (i.e., quizzes, iClicker questions). Once your data has been merged, your name or other identifying details will be removed.

Are there any potential benefits if I participate?
You will NOT directly benefit from your participation in this study. However, results from this study will help to improve the psychology curriculum for future students. It is important for instructors to understand which educational practices have a tangible impact on student's learning and which practices do not. If certain practices are found to be particularly effective they may be shared with other instructors and adopted as more permanent features to the psychology curriculum at UCD.

Will I be paid for participating? 
You may receive course credit for completing certain surveys as part of the course. You will receive this course credit regardless of whether you choose to participate in the study and allow the research team to use your data. If you withdraw from this study you will still receive credit for survey completion.

Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?
Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can identify you will remain confidential. Data will be stored on a secure two-factor password protected cloud-based service. Only members of the research team will have access to your information/data. If this research is published or disseminated data will be presented in aggregate form (as averages across a large group of people). Your individual data will not be shared outside the research team.

What are my rights if I take part in this study?
As a student enrolled in this course, you will be enrolled in this study. However, you may withdraw your information (or part of your information) from this study at any time by contacting the PI, Dr. Cross at vlcross@ucdavis.edu. There is no penalty for withdrawing from this study. Withdrawal will not impact your course grade or standing at UCD. You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.

Who can I contact if I have questions about this study?
The research team: If you have any questions, comments or concerns about the research, you can talk to the researchers. Please contact: Dr. Cross at vlcross@ucdavis.edu

You may contact the Institutional Review Board with concerns or complaints at any time, at irbadmin@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu or (916) 703-9151.",0.0,2500877: What is your age in years?(enter number only,0.0,2500878: What is your year in university?,0.0,2500879: My gender identity is:,0.0,2500880: Are you an International student?,1.0,2500881: Is English your first language?,0.0,"2500882: Which of the following best describes your academic experience when it comes to learning in English?
