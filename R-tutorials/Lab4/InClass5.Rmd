## Notes:
Sample sizes change in model fitting sequences, impacting fit statistics

Covariance structure

Within Centering, forcing min corr

age is not a random variable in the model

change in std error 

mlm missing NA at a predictor will lose the entire record. missing subject level predictor, lose entire subject record. permutation or Bayes.
